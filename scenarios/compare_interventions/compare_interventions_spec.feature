Feature: Intervention

  We implement two different interventions in Covasim: Testing and Contact Tracing. The following scenarios describe expected effect of the interventions on the cumulative number of infections.

  Background:
    # Does every `Given` have to be followed by "the"? I'd rather it was "Given that..."
    Given the every simulation is executed with at least the following default input parameters:
    * a population of 50,000
    * in the UK
    * with 100 initial infectious people
    * starting on June 1st 2021
    * ending on September 1st 2021
    # Given that every `Then` clause involves the cumulative number of infections, I'm not sure we need this bit...
    And the reports the following outputs:
    * cumulative number of infections

  Scenario: Baseline
    # Under the default input parameters (background), COVID-19 should spread through the population
    # uncontrolled until herd-immunity is reached, at which point the virus should start to die out.
    # This should result in the worst case scenario in terms of cumulative infections.
    Given no interventions are implemented
    When the simulation is complete
    Then the cumulative number of infections should be >= 70% of the population

  Scenario Outline: Testing
    # Under realistic parameter configurations, testing should always be better than
    # the baseline at reducing the number of cumulative infections.
    Given a testing intervention with the following parameters:
    * probability of testing a symptomatic individual = <symp_prob>
    * probability of testing an asymptomatic individual = <asymp_prob>
    * probability of testing a symptomatic quarantined individual = <symp_quar_prob>
    * probability of testing an asymptomatic quarantined individual = <asymp_quar_prob>
    When the simulation is complete
    Then the cumulative number of infections should be <relationship> baseline
    Examples:
      | symp_prob | asymp_prob | symp_quar_prob | asymp_quar_prob | relationship |
      | 0.2       | 0.001      | 1.0            | 1.0             | <            |
      | 0.0       | 0.0        | 0.0            | 0.0             | =            |
      | 0.5       | 0.01       | 1.0            | 1.0             | <<<          |

  Scenario Outline: Contact Tracing
    # Contact tracing is always at least as effective as testing. Under realistic parameter
    # configurations, contact tracing should be significantly better at reducing the cumulative
    # number of infections than baseline and testing.
    Given Testing
    And a contact tracing intervention with the following parameters:
    * probability of tracing a contact from the same home <h_prob>
    * probability of tracing a contact from the same workplace <w_prob>
    * probability of tracing a contact from the same school <s_prob>
    * probability of tracing a contact from the community <c_prob>
    When the simulation is complete
    Then the cumulative number of infections should be <relationship> <comparison_sim>
    Examples:
      | h_prob | w_prob | s_prob | c_prob | relationship | comparison_sim |
      | 1.0    | 0.5    | 0.5    | 0.3    | <<<          | baseline       |
      | 1.0    | 0.5    | 0.5    | 0.3    | <<<          | testing_only   |
      | 0.0    | 0.0    | 0.0    | 0.0    | =            | testing_only   |

  Scenario: Contact Tracing Without Testing
    # Contact tracing requires testing to be implemented.
    # Otherwise, contact tracing has no effect on the cumulative number of infections.
    Given Testing is not implemented
    And a contact tracing intervention with the following parameters:
    * any probability of tracing a contact from the same home
    * any probability of tracing a contact from the same workplace
    * any probability of tracing a contact from the same school
    * any probability of tracing a contact from the community
    When the simulation is complete
    Then the cumulative number of infections should be = baseline
