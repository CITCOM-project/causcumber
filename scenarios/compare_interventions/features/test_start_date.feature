    Then we obtain the causal DAG for 12 weeks

  # The model doesn't inherently take seasonal variation into account, so this will fail
  # We need to check whether a real epidemiologist would expect this to happen or whether it's just confounding like schools going back or whatever
  @fails
  Scenario: Winter vs Summer
    Given we run the model with start_day=2020-06-01
    When we run the model with start_day=2020-11-01
    # Because the cold wet weather in winter more easily facilitates disease spread
    Then the cum_infections_12 should be > control
