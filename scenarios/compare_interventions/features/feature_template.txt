    Then we obtain the causal DAG for 12 weeks

  Scenario Outline: Test and trace
    Given we run the model with interventions=<control>
    When we run the model with interventions=<treatment>
    Then the cum_deaths_12 should be <relationship> <control>
    Examples:
      | treatment     | relationship | control       |
      | standardTest  | <            | baseline      |
      | noTest        | =            | baseline      |
      | optimalTest   | <            | standardTest  |
      | standardTrace | <            | baseline      |
      | standardTrace | <            | standardTest  |
      | noTrace       | =            | standardTest  |
      | optimalTrace  | <            | standardTrace |
      | traceNoTest   | =            | baseline      |

  Scenario Outline: Locations
    Given we run the model with location=<control>
    When we run the model with location=<treatment>
    Then the cum_deaths_12 should be <relationship> <control>
    Examples:
      | treatment | relationship | control | note                                    |
      | Japan     | >            | UK      | Because Japan has an older population   |
      | Rwanda    | <            | UK      | Because Rwanda has a younger population |

  Scenario: Large population
    Given we run the model with pop_size=50000
    When we run the model with pop_size=100000
    Then the cum_infections_12 should be > control
    # And the peak should appear later # Need phase detection preprocessing for this

  # This depends on the existence of observational data. We need lots of runs to
  # get a reliable estimate. Essentially, we need to just run the model with
  # some different starting parameters. We can reuse data from prior test runs
  # by just pulling it all in. This works under the assumption that all the
  # CSV files have the same columns.
  Scenario: Subsequent mortality (has confounding)
    Given a control scenario where cum_infections_7=4000
    When cum_infections_7=5000
    Then the cum_infections_12 should be > control
