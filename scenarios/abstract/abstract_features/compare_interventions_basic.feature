    # is the following

    # deal with, but the categories are a bit more "fuzzy" here. There's not a
    # cutoff value where the model behaves like this for values above and like
    # that for values below. There's a sort of grey area in the middle where the
    # two distributions overlap where the pandemic might get going or it might not.

  Scenario: Draw DAG
    Given a connected DAG
    When we prune the following edges

    | trace_probs     | .*              |
    | location        | .*              |
    And we add the following edges
    | s1              | s2              |
    | cum_infections  | cum_deaths      |

    | n_days          | cum_deaths      |
    | location        | average_age     |
    Then we obtain the causal DAG

  # Scenario Outline: location # This is really just a proxy for age, but age isn't an input to the model

  # This is controlled entirely by location, so we want to do at least two locations with different average ages
  # Do we want to run it for every country?

    # I think the cum_tests one will probably change on the quarantine testing strategy.
    # By default, it's start and end, i.e. two tests per quarantine
    # If we tested everyone in quarantine every day, it might increase
    # Since test_strategy isn't a parameter we're testing here, we can leave it as is

    # The cum_quarantined seems to be a lot more sensitive to the effect modifiers
    # and a lot less monotonic than cum_tests. With the _prob variables at lower
    # values, increasing the quar_period actually increases the cum_quarantined.
    # It's only for the higher values (above 0.5) that we get less people quarantining.
    # This makes sense as, if we have a higher chance of someone testing and getting
    # quarantined early on, then the quar_period has much more chance of taking effect.
    # If they have a lower chance of getting caught, they'll pass it on to more people,
    # so the cumulative nature of the variable will have more of an effect

    | cum_quarantined | decrease        | Longer quarantine means fewer cases means fewer quarantine                         |
    | cum_infections  | decrease        | Longer quarantine means less chance of infected individuals passing on the disease |
    | cum_deaths      | remain the same | No direct causal effect, only via cum_infections                                   |
