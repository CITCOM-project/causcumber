  @draw_dag
  Scenario: Draw DAG
    Given a connected DAG
    When we prune the following edges
    | s1              | s2              |
    | cum_deaths      | .*              |

    | trace_probs     | .*              |
    | location        | .*              |
    And we add the following edges

    | location        | average_age     |
    | location        | household_size  |
    Then we obtain the causal DAG
