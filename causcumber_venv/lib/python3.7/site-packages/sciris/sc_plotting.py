'''
Extensions to Matplotlib, including colormaps, 3D plotting, and plot manipulations.

Highlights:
    - Adds colormaps including 'turbo', 'parula', and 'orangeblue'
    - ``sc.hex2grb()/sc.rgb2hex()``: convert between different color conventions
    - ``sc.vectocolor()``: map a list of sequential values onto a list of colors
    - ``sc.gridcolors()``: map a list of qualitative categories onto a list of colors
    - ``sc.plot3d()``:c.surf3d() # easy way to render 3D plots
    - ``sc.boxoff()``: turn off top and right parts of the axes box
    - ``sc.commaticks()``: convert labels from "10000" and "1e6" to "10,000" and "1,000,0000"
    - ``sc.SIticks()``: convert labels from "10000" and "1e6" to "10k" and "1m"
    - ``sc.maximize()``: make the figure fill the whole screen
    - ``sc.savemovie()``: save a sequence of figures as an MP4 or other movie

    Note: you do not need to create the legend before calling this function; if you do,
    you will need to pass any additional keyword arguments to this function since it will
    override existing settings.

    Args:
        order (list or array): the new order of the legend, as from e.g. np.argsort()
        ax (axes): the axes object; if omitted, defaults to current axes
        handles (list): the legend handles; can be used instead of ax

    '''
    Save a set of Matplotlib artists as a movie.

    Args:
        frames (list): The list of frames to animate
        filename (str): The name (or full path) of the file; expected to end with mp4 or gif (default movie.mp4)
        fps (int): The number of frames per second (default 10)
        quality (string): The quality of the movie, in terms of dpi (default "high" = 300 dpi)
        dpi (int): Instead of using quality, set an exact dpi
        writer (str or object): Specify the writer to be passed to matplotlib.animation.save() (default "ffmpeg")
        bitrate (int): The bitrate. Note, may be ignored; best to specify in a writer and to pass in the writer as an argument
        interval (int): The interval between frames; alternative to using fps
        repeat (bool): Whether or not to loop the animation (default False)
        repeat_delay (bool): Delay between repeats, if repeat=True (default None)
        blit (bool): Whether or not to "blit" the frames (default False, since otherwise does not detect changes )
        verbose (bool): Whether to print statistics on finishing.
        kwargs (dict): Passed to matplotlib.animation.save()

    Returns:
